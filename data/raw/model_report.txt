We built a classification model using logistic regression to predict churn.

Steps:
- One-hot encoded categorical variables
- Normalized numeric columns
- Trained with stratified 80/20 train-test split
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC

Performance:
- Accuracy: 80%
- Precision: 72%
- Recall: 69%
- ROC AUC: 0.84

The model showed high importance for features like:
- contract type
- tenure
- monthly charges

We considered XGBoost as an alternative but prioritized interpretability for business users. Logistic regression was sufficient and more transparent.

The model is now ready to be integrated into a chatbot interface for real-time Q&A and explanation.

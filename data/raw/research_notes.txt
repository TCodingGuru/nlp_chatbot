We received a dataset from TelcoX containing information about 7,043 customers, including demographics, account details, contract types, and service usage.

Key columns include:
- tenure (number of months the customer has stayed)
- contract type (month-to-month, one year, two year)
- monthly charges
- total charges
- internet service type
- churn (Yes/No)

Observations:
- Customers on month-to-month contracts have higher churn
- Shorter tenure is associated with higher churn
- High monthly charges often lead to dissatisfaction

Missing data:
- Some entries in TotalCharges were blank (fixed by converting to float and removing rows with nulls)

TelcoX is a mid-sized telecommunications company operating across Europe. Recently, the company has seen a significant increase in customer churn, especially among monthly contract users. 

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can help identify customers who are likely to cancel their service, allowing TelcoX to proactively take action (e.g., special offers, customer service outreach).

Key client goals:
- Understand what features contribute most to churn
- Create a reliable, interpretable model
- Build a tool that can be used by business analysts to flag at-risk customers

Target audience: Internal data science and customer service teams.

we built a classification model using logistic regression to predict churn. steps: - one-hot encoded categorical variables - normalized numeric columns - trained with stratified 80/20 train-test split - evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and roc auc performance: - accuracy: 80% - precision: 72% - recall: 69% - roc auc: 0.84 the model showed high importance for features like: - contract type - tenure - monthly charges we considered xgboost as an alternative but prioritized interpretability for business users. logistic regression was sufficient and more transparent. the model is now ready to be integrated into a chatbot interface for real-time
